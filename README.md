ðŸ§  Emoji Detection Using CNN

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect and classify emojis in images. The model is trained on synthetic data generated using the OpenMoji emoji set. It predicts both the emoji class and its bounding box location.

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
Python

TensorFlow / Keras

OpenCV, PIL

Jupyter Notebook

ðŸ“Š Output
The model predicts the emoji class and draws a bounding box around it in the image.
